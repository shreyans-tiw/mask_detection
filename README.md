# mask_detection
Computer Vision based system to detect whether a subject is correctly, incorrectly, or not wearing a face mask.

COVID-19 has impacted daily life of citizens and a major solution to this global pandemic is by masking up. Wearing mask correctly helps slow down the virus and thus, this project explores various deep learning image classification models to create an efficient masked facial detector.
By using deep learning models like ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, the aim of the project is to create an efficient masked facial detector by achieving a higher accuracy score on spotting people who are masked up, not masked up or masked incorrectly.
